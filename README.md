## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks used : None
- Libraries used : Fetch API (for API calls)
- Tools used : Code editor (VS Code), Browser (Chrome), API keys from OMDB API & Jikan API, imdb api, Figma, AI Tools(ChatGPT, deepseek ai)

For Hardware:
- Main components : Laptop
- Specifications: Any device with internet access
- Tools required: Web Browser (Chrome), Code editor (VS Code)

### Implementation
For Software: 
# Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
 
# Run
1. Open index.html in any browser to start using the platform.
2. For API functionality to work, make sure you have a valid API key for OMDB and Jikan APIs.

### Project Documentation
For Software:

1. Getting Started:
- Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
- Open index.html in your browser.
  
2. API Keys:
- Obtain your OMDB API key from OMDB API.
- The Jikan API is a public API, so no key is needed, but ensure the URL is correct.

3. Understanding the Code:
- The code is written in JavaScript, and the logic is simple: based on the selected mood, it fetches relevant content (movies, series, anime) from the APIs and displays them on the page.
- suggestEntertainment() is the main function that orchestrates fetching the content based on the user's mood selection.

4. Design:
- The website has a responsive design, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- A beautiful background image and typography styles set the mood for the content you're browsing.

# Diagrams
The FeelFlix project was developed to provide users with personalized entertainment recommendations based on their mood. The workflow of the project can be broken down into the following steps:

1. User Input: Users provide their current mood, which could range from emotions like happy, nostalgic, excited, or even stressed.
2. API Integration: Using the Fetch API, the mood input is sent to external APIs (OMDB for movies and Jikan for manga) to retrieve relevant content suggestions.
3. Content Curation: The data from the APIs is processed to select movies, manga, and series that best match the mood provided by the user.
4. Output Display: A tailored list of recommendations is displayed on the user interface, offering movies, manga, or series that align with the user‚Äôs emotional state.
5. UI Design: The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. No frameworks are used, keeping the design lightweight.
6. Technical Tools: The development process involved using VS Code as the code editor, Chrome as the browser for testing, and Figma for designing the layout. APIs (OMDB and Jikan) 
   provide the required content data, with AI tools (ChatGPT, Deepseek AI) assisting in content filtering and processing.
